# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task

- Display a dataset of customer related construction machines in a responsive layout
    - As part of an internal web application, we need an overview of specific customer related construction machines to check the validity of service contracts and warranties. 
    - Our dispatchers in the head office require a sortable general overview to quickly get an idea of how many contracts or warranties have already expired.
    - Our service staff, on the other hand, need to be able to compare this data on site using the serial number of the machine.

- Pour some sugar on it! (nice to have)
    - Add a little extra feature. What do you think could be useful for our stakeholders? Be creative and show us your strengths (For example: create animated graphs, use QR codes or do whatever comes to your mind).

- write test(s)
    - Write at least one simple unit or functional test for the code that you developed with any framework you want!



## Application Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Install the dependency libraries.\

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
